**PCYD Manager**

PCYD Manager is a resource management tool to keep track of members, chairpersons, and boardmembers of the Pinellas County Young Democrats. It has tiers of use:
  
    1. General member
    2. Chairperson/Boardmember
    3. Admin
    
Most member information is restricted from access, unless the user has tier 2 or tier 3 permissions. At the general member level, members can steer the focus of the club by selecting their top-5 priority issues (ie climate change, education, gun control). They are also able to find information regarding committees they can join as well as contact info for boardmembers.

At level 2, boardmembers have access to all member information--but can not edit member info. Chairpersons can manipulate the members serving on their committees.

Admins have editing access to all users as well as board members and committees.


PCYD Manager relies on Ruby on Rails for the most part, although the JavaScript branch has some areas in which I'm experimenting with adding different features, functionality, and enhancements to the user-experience.
